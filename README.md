# Calculator

The last project of TheOdinProject fundamentals!

Another fairly time somewhat difficult project (that's also fun and challenging!). Although this
project is mostly completed, the last bug relates to the issue of having too many numbers inputted
at once, with the current solution being to reset the calculator back to a default value of 0,
meaning after pressing an operator, the desired number would need to be pressed twice to work as 
intended.
